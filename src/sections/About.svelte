		<h4>About</h4>
		<p>
			Pemplates allows you to search for project templates on github, bootstraping your productivity from
			"I have to setup everything from scratch" to "This is template I need, so I can start working on my project".
		</p>

		<p>
			The use case behind this project is: "I want to create a desktop app using Electron and Svelte, but I have no idea how to setup everything".
			I went online and found a really good project that served as the starting point for Electron and Svelte app. But it took sometime to find it,
			so I decided to create Pemplates: a search engine for starter-kits, templates, ecc.
